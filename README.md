Denoising of low dose CT perfusion maps using Deep Learning

Matlab Codes* : (requires [MatConvNet](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/) )

Data: Training data is generated using the tool [digital-brain-perfusion-phantom](https://www5.cs.fau.de/research/data/digital-brain-perfusion-phantom/)

Matlab code for generating the network architecture.

Matlab code for Testing the trained network for Phantom data.
